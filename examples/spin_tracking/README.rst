.. _examples-quad-spin:

Spin Depolarization in a Quadrupole
===================================

This example illustrates the decay of the polarization vector (describing the mean of the three spin components) along the vertical y and longitudinal z directions for a beam undergoing
horizontal focusing in a quadrupole.

We use a 250 MeV proton beam with initial unnormalized rms emittance of 1 micron in the horizontal plane, and 2 micron in the vertical plane.

The beam propagates over one horizontal betatron period, to a location where the polarization vector is described by a simple expression.

In this test, the initial and final values of :math:`\langle{s_x\rangle}`, :math:`\langle{s_y\rangle}`, :math:`\langle{s_z\rangle}` must agree with nominal values.

.. _examples-fodo-spin:

Spin Depolarization in a FODO Channel
=====================================

This example illustrates the decay of the polarization vector (describing the mean of the three spin components) for a matched beam in a FODO channel.

We use a 10 GeV electron beam, with an initially 6D Gaussian distribution in the phase space.  The FODO channel and Twiss parameters are otherwise identical to
those appearing in ``examples/fodo_channel``.

The beam spin undergoes rapid mixing and depolarization.

.. _examples-sbend-spin:

Spin Depolarization in a Dipole
===============================

This example illustrates the decay of the polarization vector (describing the mean of the three spin components) along the horizontal x and longitudinal z directions for a beam undergoing
bending in the x-z plane in a sector dipole.

We use a 2 GeV electron beam.  The beam parameters (in particular, the momentum and energy spread) are artificially large in order to enhance the effect.

The beam propagates over one period, as set by the design spin tune.  By increasing the number of slices, and turning on diagnostics, one can view precession of the polarization vector about
the vertical direction.  A clean precession over 1 period becomes visible when the beam size, momentum spread, and energy spread are set to small values.

In this test, the initial and final values of :math:`\langle{s_x\rangle}`, :math:`\langle{s_y\rangle}`, :math:`\langle{s_z\rangle}` must agree with nominal values.

=================================

The beam propagates over a distance:  :math:`\Delta s = 2\pi/(Gk_s)`,

.. _examples-reversibility-spin:

Element Reversibility with Spin
===============================

In the case of linear elements, including spin, the joint spin-orbit map has the following exact reversibility property.

The effect of setting ds -> -ds is equivalent to replacing the map by its inverse.

In this test, a beam is propagated forward through an element of length ds, following by the corresponding element with length -ds.  As a result, the composite map is the identity.  This provides a non-trivial test for consistency between the spin map and the orbit map.

In this test, the initial and final spin components :math:`s_x`, :math:`s_y`, and :math:`s_z` are compared.  The norm of the change in the spin vector must lie within a very small tolerance.

.. _examples-cfbend-spin:

Spin Limiting Cases of a Combined-Function Bend
===============================================

This example tests the spin dynamics of a combined-function bend in the quad-like and bend-like limiting cases when the curvature or the quadrupole gradient are small, respectively.
The beam parameters are identical to those used in examples-cfbend, with the addition of spin.

In this test, the beam is tracked through a combined-function dipole, and then tracked backward through an element with equivalent parameters (up to a small tolerance).
Due to the s-reversibility of the maps applied, the final phase space coordinates and spin variables should coincide with their initial values.

This test computes the norm of the change in the spin polarization vector, which must be zero to within a small tolerance.

.. _examples-spin-map:

Illustration of a User-Defined Spin Map
=======================================

This example illustrates the application of a user-defined map that affects only the spin variables :math:`(s_x,s_y,s_z)`.  Spin maps are specified in the Lie-algebraic form:


:math:`\vec{s}_f = M(\zeta)\vec{s}_i` where :math:`M(\zeta)=e^{v\cdot L}e^{A\Delta\zeta\cdot L}`.

Here :math:`v` is a 3-vector that defines the axis and angle of rotation at the phase space design point, and :math:`A` is a 3x6 matrix that defines the spin-orbit
coupling for particles not on the design orbit.  Also, :math:`\Delta\zeta=(x,p_x,y,p_y,t,p_t)` denotes the 6-vector of phase space variables as deviations from the design orbit.  The quantities :math:`L_x`, :math:`L_y`, and :math:`L_z` are standard 3x3 matrices that define a basis for the Lie algebra :math:`so(3)`.

In this test, the inverses of the spin maps for a quadrupole and a sector bend are provided by the user as input.  The inverse spin map for a quadrupole is composed with
spin tracking in a quadrupole element, which should return all spin variables to their initial values.  The same procedure is repeated for a sector bend.

In this test, the vector norm of the difference between the initial and final spins for all particles tracked must vanish to machine precision.

Test of Thomas-BMT Spin Integration in a FODO Channel
=====================================================

This example tests the propagation of spin in a single period of a FODO channel that uses symplectic integration for tracking via the ExactQuad element.

The ExactQuad element incorportates the full nonlinear phase space dependence appearing in both the Hamiltonian and the Thomas-BMT equations for tracking.

The physical parameters of this FODO channel are identical with those used in examples-fodo-spin.

A small number of initial conditions are tracked, with increasing distance from the phase space design point.

The final spin variables are compared against those obtained by tracking using the Quad element, which treats both orbit and spin variables to first order in the phase space variables.

In this test, a scaling exponent is extracted when comparing the vector-norm of difference in final spin with the vector-norm of the initial phase space vector.  This exponent should be 2 (in the limit of small deviation).

.. _examples-multipole-spin:

Spin Tracking in a Multipole
============================

The example illustrates particle tracking with spin in both a thin multipole (Multipole) and a thick multipole (ExactMultipole).

This example tests general multipole spin tracking in two ways.  First, tracking through an ExactQuad is compared against tracking through an ExactMultipole, with the same
quadrupole strength.  To achieve this, forward tracking through the ExactMultipole is followed by reverse tracking through an ExactQuad of the same length.

Second, tracking through an ExactMultipole with a short value of length is compared against tracking through a thin Multipole element, using the same method.

In this test, the initial and final values of the beam moments :math:`\sigma_x`, :math:`\sigma_y`, :math:`\sigma_t`, :math:`\epsilon_x`, :math:`\epsilon_y`, and :math:`\epsilon_t` must coincide.

At the same time, the initial and final spin components :math:`s_x`, :math:`s_y`, and :math:`s_z` are compared for all particles.
The norm of the change in the spin vector must be zero to, within a small tolerance.
