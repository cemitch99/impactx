Expanding Beam in Free Space with 3D Space Charge
=================================================

A coasting bunch expanding freely in free space under its own space charge.

We use a cold (zero emittance) 250 MeV electron bunch whose
initial distribution is a uniformly-populated 3D ball of radius R0 = 1 mm when viewed in the bunch rest
frame.

In the laboratory frame, the bunch is a uniformly-populated ellipsoid, which
expands to twice its original size.  This is tested using the second moments of the distribution.

In this test, the initial and final values of :math:`\sigma_x`, :math:`\sigma_y`, :math:`\sigma_t`, :math:`\epsilon_x`, :math:`\epsilon_y`, and :math:`\epsilon_t` must agree with nominal values.

This test uses mesh-refinement to solve the space charge force.
The coarse grid wraps the beam maximum extent by 300%, emulating "open boundary" conditions.
The refined grid in level 1 spans 110% of the beam maximum extent.
The grid spacing is adaptively adjusted as the beam evolves.


Run
---

This example can be run **either** as:

* **Python** script: ``python3 run_expanding_fft.py`` or
* ImpactX **executable** using an input file: ``impactx input_expanding_fft.in``

For `MPI-parallel <https://www.mpi-forum.org>`__ runs, prefix these lines with ``mpiexec -n 4 ...`` or ``srun -n 4 ...``, depending on the system.

We also provide the same example with the multi-grid (MLMG) Poisson solver.

Expanding Beam in Free Space with 2D Space Charge
=================================================

A long, coasting unbunched beam expanding freely in free space under its own 2D space charge.

We use a cold (zero emittance) 250 MeV electron bunch whose
initial distribution is a uniformly-populated cylinder of radius R0 = 1 mm.

In the laboratory frame, the beam expands to twice its original transverse size.  This is tested using the second moments of the distribution.

Expanding Beam in Free Space with 2D Space Charge, with Test Particles
======================================================================

A long, coasting unbunched beam expanding freely in free space under its own 2D space charge.

The problem parameters are identical to :ref:`the above example <examples-expanding-fft-2d>`, except that a set of test particles is loaded and tracked, together with the main particle bunch.

The test particle data is collected once per space charge slice, using the callback hook feature, and the test particle orbits are plotted vs. distance s.

Expanding Beam in a Uniform Accelerating Field with 3D Space Charge
===================================================================

A bunch in a uniform longitudinal electric field, expanding under its own space charge.

The problem is identical to :ref:`the above example <examples-expanding-fft>`, except for the presence of the accelerating field.  
Since all forces are linear in this case, the problem is characterized by the rms envelope equations.

In this test, the final values of :math:`\sigma_x`, :math:`\sigma_y`, :math:`\sigma_t`, :math:`\epsilon_x`, :math:`\epsilon_y`, and :math:`\epsilon_t` obtained using
particle tracking must agree with the corresponding values obtained using envelope tracking.
