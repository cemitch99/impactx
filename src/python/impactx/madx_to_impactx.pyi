        MAD-X exposes this as the per-node ``other_bv`` and multiplies it into
        bend angles, body multipole strengths, solenoid KS/KSI, kicker kicks,

    :param min_model: lowest ImpactX element model tier to translate into
        ("linear", "paraxial" or "exact"). This raises the lower gate of the
        model choice only. The translator still picks the cheapest model that
        represents the MAD-X element, and a feature that already demands a
        higher tier, such as a thick octupole, keeps it. See `build` below.
    :param ref_beta_gamma: beta*gamma of the reference particle, from the MAD-X
        BEAM total energy. Only needed for models whose strength is expressed
        per unit rigidity rather than in the MAD-X k convention, currently the
        paraxial solenoid. Those models are skipped when this is unknown.
    :return: list of translated dictionaries

    Maintainer note (one-place-of-truth philosophy):
    - Keep element-type mapping in one place (the `d["type"]` chain below).
    - Keep the model-tier choice in one place per element family. Route every
      construction of a tiered element through `build(...)` with a table of the
      tiers ImpactX implements for it, so `min_model` applies uniformly.
    - Keep bend-body model choice in one place (`make_bend_body_element` below).
    - Prefer composition from existing ImpactX elements over silent drops.
    - Every physics fallback should `_warn(...)` and include a TODO comment.
